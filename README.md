# Day 3 Coding with Python
## Question of the day first!

### Exercises for Iniya
1. Explain modular arithmetic to Iniya: integer division
2. Create a while loop that displays the numbers from 1 to 50 that are divisible by 5.
3. Create a while loop that determines how many even numbers between 0 and n and how many odd numbers between 0 and n.
4. Show an example of a while loop that uses a boolean as the conditional. Have her write a while loop using a boolean.
5. Write a python program that adds all the numbers up from 1 to n including 1 and n. 

### Exercises for Alex and Daniel
1. Input and IF-ELSE structure exercise

Ask them who their favorite TV show character is, ask them why they like them. Then, have them ask the user for a name via the input function. If the user's name is the fav TV show character, have them print a special message. Otherwise have it print "Good Morning NAME".

Maybe for Daniel ask him what their pet's name is. If it is the same as his pet, output some special message with information about the pet.

2. Guess the number exercise
Have Daniel and Alex work together. Daniel picks a secret number between 1 and 10. Alex picks a secret number between 1 and 10. They each write their number down on a piece of paper that you and I keep so it adds more fun to it.
> if the number is not between one and 10: 	USE AND
	> print("invalid range")
	elif the number is their secret number:
		print(you guessed it!)
	else:
		print(hahahaha you did not guess it)

3. Introduction to loops
	Show a basic loop that counts from 1 to 10.
	Show a loop that goes on forever.
Have them do a simple while loop that counts from 1 to their secret number from before.

Do an exercise that says while(they aren't inputting a key word like "butts"): keep asking for input and printing it out.

While loop that says while(length of input==1): concatenate a single string with each letter of the input. Print out the word at the end of the while loop.
